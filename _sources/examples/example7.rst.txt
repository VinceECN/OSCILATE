Example 7: Parametrically excited Van der Pol oscillator
--------------------------------------------------------

MMS example on a Van der Pol oscillator subject to parametric forcing. 
This configuration was studied by Nayfeh and Mook in *Nonlinear Oscillations* (1995), section 5.7.2, where the Van der Pol oscillator is also called Rayleigh oscillator.

System description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system's equation is

.. math::
    \ddot{x} + c \dot{x} + \gamma \dot{x}^{3} + \omega_{0}^{2} x = -2x F \cos(\omega t),

where 

- :math:`x` is the oscillator's coordinate,
- :math:`t` is the time,
- :math:`\dot{(\bullet)} = \mathrm{d}(\bullet)/\mathrm{d}t` is a time derivative,
- :math:`c` is the linear viscous damping coefficient,
- :math:`\omega_0` is the oscillator's natural frequency,
- :math:`\gamma` is the nonlinear damping coefficient,
- :math:`F` is the forcing amplitude,
- :math:`\omega` is the forcing frequency.

A parametric response around twice the oscillator's frequency is sought so the frequency is set to

.. math::
    \omega = 2\omega_0 + \epsilon \sigma

where

- :math:`\epsilon` is a small parameter involved in the MMS,
- :math:`\sigma` is the detuning.

The parameters are then scaled to indicate how weak they are:

- :math:`c = \epsilon \tilde{c}` indicates that damping is weak,
- :math:`F = \epsilon \tilde{F}` indicates that forcing is weak,
- :math:`\gamma = \epsilon \tilde{\gamma}` indicates that nonlinear damping is weak.

Code description

The script below allows to

- Construct the dynamical system.
- Apply the MMS to the system,
- Evaluate the MMS results at steady state,
- Compute the forced response and the backbone curve,
- Evaluate the stability of the computed forced solution.
